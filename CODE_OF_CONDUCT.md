* Be especially mindful of newcomers ‚Äî guide them patiently.

### 2. Communicate Thoughtfully

* Focus feedback on code, design, or documentation ‚Äî not on individuals.

### 3. Credit & Fairness

* Do not claim credit for others‚Äô contributions.

### 5. Do Not Tolerate Abuse

The following are unacceptable and may lead to removal from the project:

* Harassment, threats, hate speech, or discriminatory remarks.
* Personal attacks, insults, or trolling.
* Spam, flooding, or derailing discussions.
* Posting malicious or inappropriate content.

### 6. Reporting & Resolution

If you see or experience violations:

2. If it continues or is severe, report to the maintainers via email (e.g., the repository owner) or GitHub‚Äôs report features.
3. In your report, include links, context, and relevant content (e.g. issue/PR comment).

### 7. Enforcement

* Maintainers reserve the right to moderate comments, close or reject PRs or issues, and remove contributors who violate this policy.
