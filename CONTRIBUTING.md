# Contributing to nextdns

Welcome! We appreciate your interest in contributing to this Python wrapper for the NextDNS API. This project is actively maintained and welcomes contributions of all types‚Äîcode, documentation, and feature ideas.

**This repository participates in Hacktoberfest!** We encourage beginners to get involved.

## üöÄ Ways to Contribute

There are several ways you can help improve `nextdns`:

1.  **Code (Bugs & Features):** Fix a reported bug or implement a new feature (like supporting a new API endpoint). All new code requires corresponding unit tests.
2.  **Documentation:** Improve the clarity of the `README.md`, docstrings, or the `example.py`.
3.  **Code Maintenance:** Fix linting/style issues identified by `ruff`, or update dependencies in `pyproject.toml` (always check for breaking changes first!).

## üí° Quick Start Checklist

To ensure your contribution is merged smoothly, please follow these steps:

1.  **Discuss First:** If you plan a large change or new feature, **please open an issue first** to discuss the idea with the maintainer.
2.  **Fork and Clone:** Fork the repository and clone your fork locally.
3.  **Create a New Branch:** Base your work on the `master` branch and create a new, descriptive branch (e.g., `feat/add-new-endpoint` or `fix/connection-bug`).

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Setup & Testing

### Environment and Style

We use **Ruff** for linting and code formatting (as seen in `pyproject.toml`). Please ensure your code meets the standard:

1.  **Format your code** before committing.
2.  Use clear, descriptive commit messages (e.g., `fix: Corrected error handling in connection.py`).

### Running Tests

Any code contribution (bug fix or new feature) **must** include working tests.

1.  Place new test files or logic inside the **`tests/`** directory.
2.  Ensure all existing and new tests pass before submitting your PR.

## ü§ù Submitting Your Pull Request (PR)

1.  Keep your PR focused on a single change.
2.  Write a clear, brief PR title (e.g., `feat: Add support for [New API Feature]`).
3.  In the PR description, explain **what** was changed and **why** it benefits the project.
4.  If you are contributing for Hacktoberfest, feel free to mention it!

Thank you for helping make `nextdns` better!
